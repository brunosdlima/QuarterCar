This folder contains a small project to simulate one quarter of a car including its subsystems.
MatLab was used along with Simulink in order to simulate the car behaviour.
The engine behaviour is simulated by means of a table with fictitious data.

For the cooling system:
The five simulated tests are as follows:
1- In first gear with the vehicle in standard C and more than 500kg towing at 22km/h and an incline of 9%
2- In second gear with the vehicle in standard C at 43 km/h and an incline of 6%
3- In second gear with the vehicle in standard C with more than 200kg towing at 43 km/h and an incline of 9%
4- In the penultimate gear in standard C at 140 km/h
5- In last gear with the vehicle in standard C at maximum speed
The mass of the vehicle in standard C was considered to be 1695 kg.
A vehicle model was implemented in simulink to calculate the useful power of the vehicle as well as the engine speed.

The reports are in portuguese.
The fuel consumption model is not fully working.
